# Atlanta 2173: Flowers vs Robot Spiders - BIGMODE2025

### Flower Power
_"Power is a tool to reach goals, not the goal itself"_

You find yourself in a strange dream-like jungle clearing softly illuminated by playful fireflies.

A few flowers catch your attention - glowing orbs of warm energy form in the embrace of their petals, gently drifting into the night sky.

At the corner of your view, you notice harsh red glow piercing through the serenity. Seven red eyes come into view, their glow glinting off the metal shape of a spider.

The metal beast rushes towards you, it's metal legs moving with eerie precision. As it reaches you and winds up a leg for a piercing strike, orbs of energy strike it in a dull explosion, destroying it.

The only thing that remains of the spider is a cube of energy suspended in air. Upon touch it bursts free, filling you with a rush of power.

Turning your attention back to the flowers, you decide to pick them up to replant elsewhere.

And so onward you go, down the path of roots and fireflies, gathering more power to be strong enough to face the source of your attacker.

### Gathering
_"Power begets power"_

When more red lights appear in the darkness, you are ready - quickly planting the flowers and preparing for a fight.

You notice that the more power you absorb, the faster you plant and move, allowing to deal with bigger threats.

What also caught your attention was the way the plants obstructed mechanical beasts. You wonder if there is a way to make the flowers grow beyond their natural size.

### Facing The Horde
_"Synergies between powers can create more than the sum of their parts"_
