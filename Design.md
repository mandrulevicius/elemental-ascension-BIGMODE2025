Shaman - nature, elements.
Power.
Mountain - hidden volcano. Maybe built over with metal imitation of a pyramid.

Elemental power - Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Lightning.
Power comes from journey, it is means to reach a destination, not the destination itself.
Power helps gather more power.
Synergies between elements create effect bigger than the sum of their parts.

4 areas, one for each basic element.
5th area - boss challenges - lightning.

4 types of gameplay challenges:
- Farming (Earth)
- Puzzles (Water)
- Traversal (Air)
- Combat (Fire)

Start at a bottom of a mountain, go through each area towards the peak.

2-4 minutes of gameplay per area!

  - Zap with super lightning strike, which not only hits it, but also ground beneath, which triggers volcanic eruption, melting the boss and lair (and also a lot of surrounding area, but once again, from ash will come new life)



## Design considerations
Want to let player use all the skills combined for longer, in 4 more areas like the first ones, just with more mobility to have fun, tools to do cool stuff.
Maybe can be after boss is beaten? Could have to go down and quickly grow out new life after lava cools off.
After getting down, can use up all gained power to shed the metal shell of the pyramid, revealing the volcano beneath.
Or leave it as a cautionary monument.


Want to add power generators that power the robots and need to be destroyed. Not sure where to slot them in?

Some pickups obvious, some hidden. Need only some to beat the game, but can do a 100% on the way down the mountain, or in new game.

Some areas enemies come at night, others triggered by picking up big power essence, or solving the puzzle, or something else.


Elements work better in their area

Uzturbint planta su cristalais


In home farm, centipedes attack to drive player forward, also show that game has enemies

## Setting
Post-war AI mama wakes up, starts overtaking nature.



## Lore delivery
Through quotes.
"Power is a tool to help reach the destination, not destination itself"
"Power begets power"
"Different powers create more than the sum of their parts"



## Technique focus
Smooth movement.
Good lighting.
Maybe procedural animations? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Gjhr1IP6w&ab_channel=Codeer


## Next tasks
### MA
Find wine 3d asset
add ability to quickly grow bonded (actual objects, not part of terrain) plants around you
 - grow garden plants
add ability to conjure vines
   (add ability to bond with plant (change from terrain to actual object))

terrain template - only added all trees, not spawned in scene yet.
also same all terrain layers

try to paint a good looking area. take references from red dead redemption2, horizon zero dawn??



( maybe after jam
**Procedural Animation**
-create simple rig
-do inverse kinematics
-add raycast and movement to it
)
